The best ist the ConvNet ShallowFBCSPNet
-----------------------------------------

Test it with different strategies:

learning_rate=0.0625 * 0.01, weight_decay_factor=0

- With cropped training
- Without cropped training
- With gaussian augmentation
- Without gaussian augmentation

Take the best model (With gauss and cropped training) and go on with
- Cosine Annealing learning_rate

If better: Take cosine annealing.

...Go on with:

L2 regularization
weight_decay_factor = 0.0001
weight_decay_factor = 0.00001
weight_decay_factor = 0.000001

=> Take the best value. 
Apply early stopping.
