# Project Description:
The project will focus on classification of movement imagination tasks using EEG signals. 

It is proven that thinking about different movement that one plans to execute, generates a different neural fooprint. This footprint can be detected by means of an EEG recording device. The goal of this project is to classify different movements that subjects may think of. We will base our project on an existing dataset (link: https://www.physionet.org/physiobank/database/eegmmidb/#experimental-protocol ). The methods and scope of the project are to be defined in the next weeks. 

Note: In case enough data cannot be found, we will focus on EEG artifact removal, instead.

# Steps
1) Load the data.
2) Visualise the data (and understand the event info).
3) Normalize the data, and save it(?).
